    Topic: AI Use In Cloud Computing
Article: Revolutionizing America's Cloud Computing the Pivotal Role of AI in Driving Innovation and Security
Reference: http://jaigs.org/index.php/JAIGS/article/view/43/32 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used across all technological domains, including cloud computing, where it is mainly focused on “automatic scaling and self-healing systems within cloud infrastructures”. This means that AI is being used to try and introduce systems that can scale by themselves when necessary, and fix themselves in the case of any errors or failures. This allows for more optimised resource management. In my opinion this would have clear benefits to both cloud service providers, in the form of cheaper costs of maintenance, as well as customers, in the form of better performing services.
AI is largely based on machine learning models, and these can be very resource expensive to run. The cloud can be leveraged as a platform for running these models, thanks to the large amount of resources that are available in these cloud based systems, as well as their scalability. This has the potential to be more cost effective than using on-premise hardware, as the pay-as-you-go model charges only for the resources that have been used.
There already exist some cloud based AI-related services, “exemplified by platforms such as IBM Watson, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, AWS Deep Learning AMIs, Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, among others”.
Despite the innovative potential, there are some challenges that need to be solved going forward such as protecting sensitive data and user privacy, as new AI technologies also will bring about new threats. The paper also states that price competitions among cloud service providers help to bring increasingly lower costs to consumers, it may impact future profitability - I believe that there is a risk that this may become a significant issue that could stifle the progress of introducing cloud-based AI services. This is because in my opinion if there is no profit incentive, the drive for innovation could plummet.
